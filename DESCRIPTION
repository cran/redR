Description: Regularization by Denoising uses a denoising engine to solve
  many image reconstruction ill-posed inverse problems. This is a R
  implementation of the algorithm developed by Romano et.al. (2016) <arXiv:1611.02862>. Currently,
  only the gradient descent optimization framework is implemented. Also,
  only the median filter is implemented as a denoiser engine. However,
  (almost) any denoiser engine can be plugged in. There are currently available
  3 reconstruction tasks: denoise, deblur and super-resolution. And again,
  any other task can be easily plugged into the main function 'RED'.
